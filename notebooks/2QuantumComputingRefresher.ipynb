    "### 2.1 Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "A qubit is a basic unit of quantum computation, analogous to a bit in classical computation.\n",
    "Unlike a classical bit which can only be 0 or 1 at once, a qubit may exist in a superposition of both states simutaneously with some probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum states of $0$ (ket 0) and $1$ (ket 1) can be represented by vectors in Dirac notation: $ \\quad\n",
    "\\lvert 0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\[6pt] 0\\end{pmatrix} \\,,\\qquad \\lvert 1 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\[6pt] 1\\end{pmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "A pure qubit state (since it is a superposition of basis states $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$), can be described by a linear combination as: $\n",
    "{\\displaystyle |\\psi \\rangle =\\alpha |0\\rangle +\\beta |1\\rangle } $ where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers representing probability amplitudes. A qubit collapses into a basis state of $|0⟩$ or $|1⟩$ only upon measurement, with probabilities $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ respectively. Prior to measurement, a qubit always exists as a superposition of states. It is also worth noting that $ {\\displaystyle |\\alpha |^{2}+|\\beta |^{2}=1} $ (all probabilities in a set must sum to $1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have more than one qubit, we describe its joint state via a tensor product. Each qubit lives in a 2-dimensional space spanned by $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$. It is worth noting that a tensor product $(⊗)$ stacks vectors as follows: $\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\end{pmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{pmatrix}c\\\\d\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix} a\\,c\\\\ a\\,d\\\\ b\\,c\\\\ b\\,d \\end{pmatrix}$\n",

    "### 2.2 Quantum Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a qubit might be something like the spin of an electron or the polarisation of a photon. Each of these systems can be \"manipulated\" by physical operations like lasers or pulses, which act similar to **quantum logic gates** that transform qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to logic gates like NOT, AND, etc. which manipuate bits in classical circuits, we have quantum logic gates which operate on a set of qubits. Mathematically, each state is a column vector $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$, and each gate is a unitary matrix $U$ satisfying $U^†U=I$. Unitarity keeps the total probability $\\langle \\psi|\\psi \\rangle = 1$ and every gate is also reversible $(U^{-1}=U^{\\dagger})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common single-qubit gates are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X gate**: analogous to the classical NOT gate, this simply flips the qubit state: $X\\lvert 0\\rangle = \\lvert 1\\rangle$ and $X\\lvert 1\\rangle = \\lvert 0\\rangle$. Mathematucally, $X = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\[6pt] 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z gate**:  phase flip gate which flips only a $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ bit such that $Z\\lvert 1\\rangle = \\lvert 0\\rangle$ and $Z\\lvert 0\\rangle = \\lvert 0\\rangle$. Mathematically, $Z = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H gate**: the Hadamard gate transforms $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ into an equal superposition of $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ and $\\lvert 1\\rangle$. Mathematically, $H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\[6pt] 1 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S gate**: introduces a phase shift of 90-degrees ($\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians) only to the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state. Mathematically, $S = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & i\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T gate**: introduces a phase shift of 45-degrees ($\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians) only to the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state. Mathematically, $T = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & e^{i\\pi/4}\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other two and three bit gates include (we omit the mathematical representations here as they are more complex):\n",
    "- **CNOT gate**: a two qubit gate that flips the target qubit only if the control qubit is in the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "- **Toffoli gate**: aka the CCNOT not gate, a three-qubit gate with two controls that flips the target qubit only if **both** controls are in the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "- **SWAP gate**: a two qubit gate that swaps the states of two qubits.\n"
