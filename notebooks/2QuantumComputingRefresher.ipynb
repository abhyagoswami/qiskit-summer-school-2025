    "A qubit is a basic unit of quantum computation, analogous to a bit in classical computation. Unlike a classical bit which can only be 0 or 1 at once, a qubit may exist in a superposition of both states simutaneously with some probability. \n",

    "The quantum states of $0$ (ket 0) and $1$ (ket 1) can be represented by vectors in Dirac notation: $ \\quad\n",
    "\\lvert 0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\[6pt] 0\\end{pmatrix} \\,,\\qquad \\lvert 1 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\[6pt] 1\\end{pmatrix} $\n",

    "- A qubit collapses into a basis state of $|0⟩$ or $|1⟩$ only upon measurement, with probabilities $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ respectively. Prior to measurement, a qubit always exists as a superposition of states. \n",

    "### 2.2 Quantum Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a qubit might be something like the spin of an electron or the polarisation of a photon. Each of these systems can be \"manipulated\" by physical operations like lasers or pulses, which act similar to **quantum logic gates** that transform qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to logic gates like NOT, AND, etc. which manipuate bits in classical circuits, we have quantum logic gates which operate on a set of qubits. Mathematically, each state is a column vector $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$, and each gate is a unitary matrix $U$ satisfying $U^†U=I$. Unitarity keeps the total probability $\\langle \\psi|\\psi \\rangle = 1$ and every gate is also reversible $(U^{-1}=U^{\\dagger})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common single-qubit gates are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X gate**: analogous to the classical NOT gate, this simply flips the qubit state: $X\\lvert 0\\rangle = \\lvert 1\\rangle$ and $X\\lvert 1\\rangle = \\lvert 0\\rangle$. Mathematucally, $X = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\[6pt] 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z gate**:  phase flip gate which flips only a $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ bit such that $Z\\lvert 1\\rangle = \\lvert 0\\rangle$ and $Z\\lvert 0\\rangle = \\lvert 0\\rangle$. Mathematically, $Z = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H gate**: the Hadamard gate transforms $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ into an equal superposition of $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ and $\\lvert 1\\rangle$. Mathematically, $H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\[6pt] 1 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S gate**: introduces a phase shift of 90-degrees ($\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians) only to the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state. Mathematically, $S = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & i\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T gate**: introduces a phase shift of 45-degrees ($\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians) only to the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state. Mathematically, $T = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\[6pt] 0 & e^{i\\pi/4}\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other two and three bit gates include (we omit the mathematical representations here as they are more complex):\n",
    "- **CNOT gate**: a two qubit gate that flips the target qubit only if the control qubit is in the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "- **Toffoli gate**: aka the CCNOT not gate, a three-qubit gate with two controls that flips the target qubit only if **both** controls are in the $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ state.\n",

    "### 2.3 Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the basics, we must recall our mathematical background before we can build further. First let's recall basics to help us understand further concepts. Recall that Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the familiar gemoetric space where $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a plane, $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is the 3D space, and so on. Vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are $n$-dimensional vectors: $\\hat{v} = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)$, and the dot product $\\hat{v} \\cdot \\hat{u}$. Quantum states do not live in the $\\mathbb{R}^n$ Euclidean space, but rather in a **complex** vector space that often has infinite dimensions, called the **Hilbert space**. Formally, a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ is a vector space over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ that is a complete inner product space. Essentially, you can measure lengths and angles using the inner product and all Cauchy sequences converge (completeness).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the quantum notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ket**: represents a column vector in a Hilbert space $|ψ⟩$, notation used to represent a quantum state of a system, e.g. a single qubit $\\lvert 0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\[6pt] 0\\end{pmatrix}$. \n",
    "- **Bra**: denoted $\\langle \\phi|$, it is the Hermitian conjugate (complex-conjugate transpose) of a ket. $\\langle \\phi| = (|\\phi\\rangle)^†$.\n",
    "    - If $|\\phi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\[6pt] b\\end{pmatrix}$, then $\\langle \\phi| = \\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
    "- **Operator**: a matrix $U$ that acts on kets to transform states, e.g. quantum gates or observables.  \n",
    "    - Must be **unitary** (for gates) or **Hermitian** (for measurements).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will explore other mathematical concepts related to vectors (which represents quantum states) and matrices (which represents gates):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spanning set**: the spanning set (or the basis) for a vector space is a set of vectors $\\{|v_1\\rangle, ... , |v_n\\rangle\\}$ such that any vector in the space can be written as a linear combination $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i a_i |v_i \\rangle$ of vectors in that set. \n",
    "    - For example, let $|v_1\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|v_2\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, then $|v\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = a_1|v_1\\rangle + a_2|v_2\\rangle$.\n",
    "- **Complex conjugate**: for complex values $a+bi$, the complex conjugate has the same real part with the imaginary part of the opposite sign: $a-bi$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inner product**: the overlap between two states $\\lvert \\psi_1 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert \\psi_2 \\rangle$ is given by the inner product $ \\langle \\psi_1 | \\psi_2 \\rangle$: $ \\langle \\phi \\mid \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}a^* & b^*\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}c \\\\[4pt] d\\end{pmatrix} = a^*c + b^*d$ where $\\lvert\\phi\\rangle=(a,b)^T$ and $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle=(c,d)^T$. Note that this returns a scalar value.\n",
    "- **Tensor product**: (as mentioned earlier).\n",
    "- **Hamiltonian**: a special Hermitian operator $\\hat H$ that encodes the total energy of a system and generates its time evolution via the Schrödinger equation $ i\\hbar\\,\\frac{d}{dt}\\lvert\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\hat H\\,\\lvert\\psi(t)\\rangle$. \n",
    "- **Eigenstate & eigenvalue**: for an operator $\\hat A$, an **eigenstate** $\\lvert a_i\\rangle$ satisfies $ \\hat A\\,\\lvert a_i\\rangle = a_i\\,\\lvert a_i\\rangle$, where $a_i$ is the corresponding **eigenvalue**.  Measuring $\\hat A$ on $\\lvert a_i\\rangle$ always yields $a_i$.\n",
    "    <details>\n",
    "  <summary>Example.</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "  Suppose we have the operator $\\hat{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0\\\\[6pt] 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and it is being applied to $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$. Then $\\hat{A} \\lvert 0 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0\\\\[6pt] 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\[4pt]0\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\[4pt]0\\end{pmatrix} = 2\\,\\lvert 0 \\rangle$.

    "### 2.4 Postulates of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are certain postulates that we must consider to be true in quantum mechanics. There are five postulates which enable us to understand:\n",
    "- How a quantum state is described at any given time $t$.\n",
    "- How to calculate the various physical quantities from this quantum state.\n",
    "- How to follow the time evolution of a given quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The postulates are as follows:\n",
    "1. **State vector**: every quantum system is completely described at any time by a state vector $∣ψ(t)⟩$ in a (complex) Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. Any superposition of state vectors $∣ψ_1⟩$ and $∣ψ_2⟩$ is also a state vector $\\alpha∣ψ_1⟩ + \\beta∣ψ_2⟩$ for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "2. **Observables as Hermitian Operators**: every measurable physical quantity $A$ known as an observable, is represented as a Hermitian operator $\\hat{A}$ whose eigenvalues form a complete basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measurements & Eigenvalues**: if you measure observable $\\hat A$ on a system in state $\\lvert \\psi(t) \\rangle$, the only possible results are its eigenvalues $a_i$.\n",
    "    - Suppose we have an eigenvalue equation $\\hat{A}∣a_i⟩ = a_i∣a_i⟩$ where $a_i$ are the eigenvalues and $∣a_i⟩$ the eigenvectors. Then any state $∣ψ⟩$ can be represented as $∣ψ⟩ = \\sum_i c_i∣a_i⟩$ and $c_i = \\langle a_i | \\psi \\rangle$. \n",
    "    - When you measure an observable (like a particle's position, spin, momentum, etc.) in state $∣ψ⟩$, you get an outcome $a_i$ (an eigenvalue).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Probability of Outcomes**: when we measure a system that is in state $\\lvert\\psi\\rangle\\$, the probability of obtaining one of the nondegenerate eigenvalues $a_i$ is given by $P(a_i) = \\frac{\\bigl|\\langle \\psi_i \\mid \\psi\\rangle\\bigr|^2}{\\langle \\psi \\mid \\psi\\rangle}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time Evolution of System**: the state of a system evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation $i\\hbar\\,\\frac{d}{dt}\\,\\lvert\\psi(t)\\rangle \\;=\\; \\hat H\\,\\lvert\\psi(t)\\rangle$ where $\\bar{h}$ is the reduced Planck constant and $\\hat H$ is the system’s **Hamiltonian** (the total energy operator, Hermitian). \n",
    "    - The formal solution is $\\lvert\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-iH\\,t}\\;\\lvert\\psi(0)\\rangle$.\n",
